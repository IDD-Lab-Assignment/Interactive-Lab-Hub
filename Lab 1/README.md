# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_

## Part A. Plan 

**Storyboard 1**
<picture>
  <img alt="Storyboard 1" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Storyboard1.jpeg">
</picture>

_Setting:_ The interaction is happening at the user's house. 

_Players:_ Players will include the Type 2 diabetes patient and the patient's family.  

_Activity:_ When the patient's family sees the lightening signal, he/she will remind the patient to follow the routine and do things on the list. 

_Goals:_ The patients needs to do what the lightening reminds them to do, and the family needs to remind patients to do what they need to do.  


_Feedback:_ Make sure the device can show multiple tasks at the same time. Also, it is important to build a relationship between different colors and tasks.

**Storyboard 2**

  <img alt="Storyboard 2" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/storyboard2.jpeg">
</picture>

_Setting:_ The interaction is happening at the user's house
_Players:_ Players will be users who have hearing impairments
_Activity:_ When the users see the lightening on the wall, they can know whether there are people outside, packges dropped outside or if someone rang the doorbell.
_Goals:_ The users will go to the door and open the door to pick up the package, meet the person and report any suspicious situation.


_Feedback:_ 
Jonathan Tan: Very interesting interaction designed for people with hearing impairment. Can also think about designs for people wearing hearing aid and be more creative.
Zixiong: Great idea! If it is hard for distance detector to differentiate different people and their purposes you can always have a device outside for them to choose from. 

**Storyboard 3**

<picture>
  <img alt="Storyboard 3" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Storyboard3.jpeg">
</picture>

_Setting:_ The interaction can happen at anywhere

_Players:_ Players will be the kids with Autism and their parents.

_Activity:_ When the parents see the light of the stuffed animal, they will know what their kids are thinking about and respond accordingly to the emotions.

_Goals:_ The goal of the kids are to communicate their feelings to parents, and the goal of the parents is to understand their kids. 


_Feedback:_ Love how you care about minorities like children with autism. I really like the leave me alone button which can show that you thought about the player's need from his/her perspective.

**Storyboard 4**

<picture>
  <img alt="Storyboard 4" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Storyboard4.jpeg">
</picture>

_Setting:_ The interaction is happening at the user's house.

_Players:_ Player will only be the user with hearing impairment.

_Activity:_ The player will play the music he/she wants to listen through speaker.

_Goals:_ The player can interact and enjoy music in a visual form. 


_Feedback:_ Visualizing sound is not a new thing but I never thought about using it to serve people with hearing impairment! Designing how music looks like is gonna be a very difficult but awesome job!

**Storyboard 5**

<picture>
  <img alt="Storyboard 5" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Storyboard5.jpeg">
</picture>

_Setting:_ The interaction is happening outside, on the road.

_Players:_ The wheelchair users and the passengers on the road are all involved. 

_Activity:_ The passengers will come over to the wheelchair users when they see lights. 

_Goals:_ The wheelchair user can get help from passengers when the light signal indicates the wheelchair got stuck. 


_Feedback:_ This is one of my favorite idea! Usually the disabled has to use his/her voice to ask for help. Having the light on wheelchairs can alert people that is further away and at the same time avoid potential embarrassment. 

**Storyboard 6**

<picture>
  <img alt="Storyboard 6" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Storyboard6.jpeg">
</picture>

_Setting:_ The interaction can happen anywhere. 

_Players:_ Players will include the patient with Congenital Insensitivity to Pain (CIP) and the patient's friends and families. 

_Activity:_ The patient's family and friends will grab the patients according to light signal.

_Goals:_ The goal is to avoid injury for patients with CIP.


_Feedback:_ This is a lovely idea. I think the device will use a pressure sensor to detect force so one potential problem might be false triggering.

**Storyboard 7**

<picture>
  <img alt="Storyboard 7" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2022/Lab%201/Storyboard7.jpeg">
</picture>

_Setting:_ The interaction is happening at the user's house. 

_Players:_ Players will include the user only.

_Activity:_ The user will look at the light and get information.

_Goals:_ The user tries to get constant reminder of his/her financial budget from the light indication.

_Feedback:_ I love this idea. I always need to go to the online banking account to check my budget and having a visualization of it is more convenient and at the same time more tangible than numbers. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

I used Tinkerbelle to act out, and I found that for some ideas I had multiple displays to show different light signals for interaction, but when acted out, I only have one mobile screen. Also, some of the devices I designed are at a smaller size so the acting out using mobile device could not really imitate the situaion. 

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

In one of the storyboards, I created a light show for people with hearing impairment to know whether there are people outside of the door. From discussing with one of my classmates, we had a new idea that maybe for people with artificial hearing tools, light signal can indicate to the speaker that whether his/her speaking volume is loud enough for the user to hear. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

Overall the tool is great, but I was a bit confused about the sound function. It seems like it can provide the sound by recognizing the words we type in, but it would be better if a list of available sounds can be provided. It was difficult for me to come up with sound choices on top of my head. 

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

**Video 1**

**Video 2**

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

**Device 1**

</picture>

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

It is concerned here that the mobile display might be too big for a wearable device design. Also whether it will be a comfortable device for people to wear is what the design needs to look into. 

**Device 2**

<picture>
  <img alt="Device 2" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/ecec507dd7a63962c23fddf694cd38ba2b5e7fbc/Lab%201/Device2.jpg">
</picture>

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

If multiple mobile device could work simultaneously, it could be a great design opportunity for the device. Also it is concerned that whether the mobile device will be too small of a size as a light signal now. 

**Device 3**

<picture>
  <img alt="Device 3" src="https://github.com/IDD-Lab-Assignment/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/ecec507dd7a63962c23fddf694cd38ba2b5e7fbc/Lab%201/Device3.jpg">
</picture>

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

It is concerning that whether the mobile display is actually a necessary component of the design, because it seems like the device could work the same way with sensors and light bulbs even without the mobile device. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Feedback 1:

Good job ideating and storyboarding. I understood all of your ideas via the storyboards.  I also thought your videos worked well and were well polished. I found the costumed device section was slightly difficult to understand.

Feedback 2:

1. I think the three of the videos are great.

2. I think you can probably place the light a little bit closer in the video to draw attention to it.

3. I think the video is very good, because the video is thoroughly thought of for people with visual and hearing impairment.

Feedback 3:

Great ideas! I like the way you make the lights based on the music. The idea that the device will change color according to the person who's knocking is also great! Maybe combined with vibration.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

For Part 2, I incorporated feedback and made some revision to storyboards. For storyboards that were commented as easy to understand, had motivation & reactions already, I kept them unchanged. 

## Storyboards

**Storyboard 1**
