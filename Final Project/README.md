# Final Project

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 15

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 17

Functional check-off - November 29 & December 1

Final Project Presentations - December 6

Write-up and documentation due - December 12

## Objective

The project plan details are shown in the PowerPoint Slide below:

Our initial plan was to design to rethink the topic of death. For example, to build a new way for people to interact with the deceased at the temple or graveyard. However, as we discussed more along the design process, we got inspiration from the movie Coco. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been forgotten. When there‚Äôs no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the final death.‚Äù 

We want to make the memory of the deceased long-lasting, and therefore we designed our final project - Afterlife Garden. 

The key objectives of our project include:
- Let users interact with each family members‚Äô item, reminisce their lives, and remember intimate moments
- Educate the younger family members of their family history and heritage
 
## Description
Afterlife Garden is an interactive device for educational purpose. The goal is to design on the topic of death to help children understand and better connect to and remember the beloved family members who have passed away.

All device components and parts we used:
- Physical device
    - Laser cut cardboard
    - Hot glue
    - Acrylic paint
    - Tree branch
    - Origami paper
    - Scissors
    - Mobile Phone
- Sensors and electronics
    - Raspberry Pi
    - Neopixel light strip
    - Capacitive sensor
    - Alligator clips (5)
    - Copper tape
    - Servo Control ‚Äì Micro Servo Motor SG51 and Qwiic Servo Controller
    - Battery pack (3)
    - Speaker
    - Jumper wires

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

3. Documentation of design process
4. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
5. Video of someone using your project
6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.


## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.

# Final Project Idea

In this project, we are exploring the possibilities in re-thinking the way we interact with our loved ones who have passed away.

## Key objectives

We want to design an interactive device that helps to:
- Let users interact with each family members‚Äô item, reminisce their lives, and remember intimate moments
- Educate the younger family members of their family history and heritage

The idea is still in exploratory stage and we are going to experiment many ways in forming the product.

**Possible parts**
- Cardboard (prototyping)
- Display screen
- Proximity sensor (possibly)
- LED light (possibly)
- MQTT üòä

**Key risks**
- Product does not evoke the intended emotions
- Users find it difficult to set up
- Designed interactions are not intuitive enough

In the case we face challenging constraints, we would consider the following fallback plans:
- Make it for commercial use instead in columbariums
- Switch to our secondary idea about educational game
